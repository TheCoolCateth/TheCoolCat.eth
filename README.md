MinecraftGames.eth Pass (MGP) whitepaper idea
Welcome to the MinecraftGames.eth Main proposal.

The changing world of PFP collection(s), utility tokens with & without art, CCO, full rights, and no rights will continue to evolve growing rapidly and slowly in different aspects.
This will make it next to impossible for many people interested in the
perks and exclusives of the most exciting NFT projects(s) due to limited
supply, utility, high demand, and floor prices most can’t afford.
We (see us) created MinecraftGames.eth Pass and GamesPassDAO to solve this problem.
Owning a MinecraftGames.eth Pass acts as membership to GamePassDAO. The
plan is for GamePassDAO to acquire NFTs, Shares & locked value voted on by its members through proposals, the main goal will be to acquire as many NFT(s), shares in, utility, total locked value as possible in Minecraft, strong Minecraft Games that exist and will be created in the future, P2E is the future of gaming.
The goal of this is to give the MinecraftGames.eth Pass DAO members access to all of
the utility, perks, ability to pick skins out of pools, worlds, private servers, dApps, and private engineers as voted on in Proposals, DEVs, grants to members to build, a rotating paid leadership group for all that want to apply.
My personal goal is to grow the GamePassDao forever until we either own Minecraft or close to haha I want my rewards to come more so once I have helped build something cool, check out the % of where the allocation of funds will go for more on that
Initial Mint
MinecraftGames.eth Pass will be 0.05 Eth each to mint.
The initial pre-sale mint of the MinecraftGames.eth Pass will start on *********.
The public sale will start on **********.
All passes will be revealed on *********.
There will be 20,000 MinecraftGames.eth Pass available to mint. The reason we selected
20,000 was to give as many people as possible access to the fractionalized
and shared utility that the DAO yields to its members. 

70% - of all mint sales will be allocated to the GamePassDAO for NFT, share & value acquisition as voted on by DAO members.

25% - will be allocated to the community proposal, growth, and engineering
fund. 

5% - for the team to build a personal future.

These funds will be used to ramp up the team underneath the MinecraftGame.eth Pass and aid in building out the core tech, dApps, and browser extension to streamline the management of proxy utility, DAO governance, and perks of acquired NFT(s), share, TLV & all purchases to DAO members.
Additionally, the investor advisors, community, and engineering fund will also be used to drive community growth, visibility, and awareness of the project as these types of
proposals are presented to the DAO by the team.

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
MGP (MinecraftGame.eth Pass)

The DAO will be structured in such a way that we are only required to own a minimum of
1 MGP to be a member. Each member can claim the utility benefit(s) that the
DAO will offer Proxy Ownership via the facilitation through the GamePassDAO Vault.

Fractionalized ownership for held NFTs will be determined by the number of
MGPs you own. The more MGPs owned by your address means greater
fractionalized ownership. Every MGP provides the same fixed amount
of fractionalized ownership, regardless of its rarity or traits.

The Art changing system & DAO
The art will be selected at a later date by the DAO, the art can be individual derivatives of vault assets with CCO or professional derivatives through to avatar images, can be made and changed at any time, this will allow individuals to change their MGP NFT image through the website once full governance is taken over via the DAO as to not allow any ambiguity on Copywrite ownership of NFT art.
The GamePassDAO is utilizing a fork of Compound Governance and is the
main governing body of MGP and GamePassDAO's Vault assets, as well
as acquisition and liquidation decisions. The implementation has been inspired by the proven work of the Nouns DAO project as a DAO votes may be delegated, but by default will be allocated to each MGP holder.
MGP NFT holder's address and transferred to new owner addresses upon a
sale, regardless of the existing delegation.
1 MGP NFT = 1 DAO Vote.
1 MGP NFT = 1/20,000 fractionalized ownership of the DAO’s NFTs,
tokens, etc.

All liquidity, NFT purchases, liquidations, and yields.
Acquisition of NFTs and liquidation shall be done through DAO proposals.
Acquired NFTs yield complete proxied utility to all holders to the fullest
extent possible.
NFTs liquidated shall have funds returned to the DAO for future acquisition
and utilization as proposed by the DAO.
How Is Proxying NFT Utility Possible?
Nearly every NFT project relies on connecting a wallet to verify NFT
ownership using a browser extension like Metamask, coinbase wallet, etc.
Or require you to generate a message signed with a wallet that owns an
NFT for the project.
Herein lies where we propose the idea of a hybrid read-only (often called
watch-only) wallet managed by the DAO, allowing DAO members to have
the necessary read-only and limited signature generation rights to the
the wallet that holds NFTs the DAO has selected to acquire. All without ever
exposing a private key or ability to transfer or submit transactions with the
wallet.
We intend to do this by extending the functionality of the open-source
MetaMask extension, while being within the bounds of their license.
For the technical implementation, we intend to do this by creating a
read-only wallet implementation within a forked version of metamask as
well as creating a signing service to proxy allowed signed messages
through the community vault wallet.
The result is the ability to verify ownership for any NFT project and
access holder perks for those projects, and more as if those NFTs were
exclusively owned by you and as if they were in your local MetaMask
wallet.
Additionally, all of this will be made open-source and publicly viewable
through the git repositories we’ll provide. All code and implementations will be open to being fully reviewed by peers in the community before going live.
Lastly, this will be done in such a way that it does not conflict with your
existing MetaMask extension. It will run entirely separate and be specific to
verification for NFTs GamePassDAO holds.

Secondary Market Royalties
70% of all secondary market royalties will be deposited into the GamePassDAO, forever.

20% will be distributed to the engineering and
community fund to further the project’s growth and development.

10% will go to the team via floor purchases of MGP(s)

How Will Fractionalized Drops Work?
NFTs that GampPassDAO holds will yield drops of some kind in the future as per $APE etc
For these drops, the resulting tokens (fungible and non-fungible), will be
stored in the DAO and ownership distributed through the same
fractionalized ownership mechanism as all existing tokens in the collection.
Utilization of these drops is up to the decision of the DAO members through only
approved proposals.

How Will Discrepancies And Governance Be Handled?
After initial mint, the DAO will ultimately have full control and decision over
any discrepancies and project direction not outlined in the whitepaper.
I don’t know what half This Means, What’s the TLDR?
By owning at least 1 MGP NFT, you are a member of GamePassDAO - a decentralized organization that buys and sells NFTs proposed by and voted on by DAO members to give access to more benefits for all members.
You also own a percentage of the NFTs owned by GamePassDAO so
long as you own at least 1 MGP NFT.
GamePassDAO members have access to the entirety of perks, utility
and benefits yielded by NFTs held in the community vault.
This is possible through something called a watch-only wallet, our own
clever open source chrome extension, and a guarded signature delegation
the system that lets you prove ownership when attempting to connect to
projects via metamask to “prove” ownership and access utility, which will be
possible by the proxy system.
This means that should an NFT project that The GamePassDAO holds an
NFT opens up an exclusive game, content, event, etc and they require
proof of ownership to access those perks, all GamePassDAO members
will be able to access those perks by proxied ownership of the associated

NFT(s) held in the DAO’s community vault.
This is as simple & automated as connecting your wallet to a
dApp with Metamask as most are used to now obviously. There will not be complex
processes and the implementations of everything proposed for all dApps,
extensions, etc
